# Introduction to Model View Controller with ASP.NET Core.

    Creating Process:
    
        * Controller : Interface
            - Create the default controller
            - Controller suffix is expected on controller name
            - ex: HomeController
        * Action : Get Data
            - Create an action
            - Controller action
            - Public method in the controller
            - Typically returns IActionResult
        * View : Display Associated Content
            - Create a view
            - By default view name must match action and be in specific folder
            - /Views/ControllerName/ActionName
            - Visual Studio Razor View Template

This website has more starter code than the empty template for an ASP.NET Core MVC website.
Having a little more content allows for focusing on what makes a basic MVC website functional,
allowing the student to build a basic website themselves.
